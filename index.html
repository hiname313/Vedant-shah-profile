        <p>My name is Vedant Shah I have many hobbies. One of them is to code. The first coding language 
        I learnt was python, then I learnt HTML and CSS. After that, I learnt how to code on swift, which is a mac coding language 
    that lets you devolop ios apps. My first ever app was a screen time app. You would have to answer questions and it would give you 
your recomended screen time. One of my other hobbies is learning stock investing with my dad. He taught me about multiple terms such 
as P/E ratio and Earnings Per Share. He also taught me how the stock market works. My final hobby is to play cricket. I go to shivaji Park in 
Mumbai and play cricket with 19 year old bois. I enjoy cricket. </p>
